# Introduction

Detecting anomalies in large, complex datasets is a critical challenge, particularly when only a small set of labeled examples is available. Traditional anomaly detection methods either rely heavily on unsupervised learning, which overlooks labeled data, or supervised methods that struggle with limited labeled samples. Recently, there has been increasing interest in semi-supervised approaches to anomoly detection. However, these approaches often do not fully leverage the avalible information avalible in the labled set.

In response to these challenges, **DualAutoNet** leverages a **dual-autoencoder ensemble** approach to semi-supervised anomaly detection. Inspired by techniques like **Deep Structured Anomaly Detection (Deep SAD)**, DualAutoNet employs two models—a positive and a negative autoencoder—that exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to their fullest extent.

By inverting the labels for the negative model and combining the outputs of both models, DualAutoNet maximizes the utilization of limited anomaly labels while learning robust representations of normal and anomalous data. The resulting ensemble scoring technique provides a robust framework for detecting outliers even in datasets with few labeled samples.

In this post, we’ll dive into:
- The **core concepts** of the DualAutoNet approach.
- The **semi-supervised learning process** used to train the dual autoencoders.
- The **ensemble score calculation** for identifying anomalies.
